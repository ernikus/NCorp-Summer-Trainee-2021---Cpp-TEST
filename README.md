# NCorp Summer Trainee 2021 - Cpp TEST
## This is the List of Programs from the Test on NCorp Summer Trainee 2021
### 1. 6-Digit Clock

Write the function that received 6 int values (range from 0 to 9).

The function has to generate the lowest hour (from **1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6** - to this **12:34:56**).

If function gets only zeros - the output is 00:00:00.

But remember if there is at least one other number like **0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0** - the output **IS NOT** 00:00:01 - but **01:00:00**.

If there is not any possible combination to create correct hour - function returns **"ERROR"**.

### 2. Only One Swap

Write the function that received an int vector filled with random numbers (range from 0).

This vector should contain an increasing sequence of numbers.

The function returns True if the vector is ascending or only one swap is required to fix it.

In other situations - function returns False.

### 3. CODE CORRECTION

*Honestly, I don't remember this task precisely enough, so I tell you what I remember.*

In that exercise you had to **find the error in the code - and correct it**.

You could **modify max 2 lines of code** - program was about 20-30 lines long.

You have also the instruction what this code should do.
